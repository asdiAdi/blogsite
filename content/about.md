Hi, I'm Carl, a web developer with over two years of experience in frontend development,now transitioning into full-stack development.
I specialize in JavaScript related frameworks with growing expertise in backend and cloud development using AWS web services.

I enjoy building web applications and exploring new technologies to push my skills further.
Lately, I've been expanding my knowledge in Docker and cloud deployment.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m passionate about 3D printing, making keyboards from scratch, and recently, game development.
My current goal is to create tools that help me expand my skillset, learn new technologies, and refine my problem-solving abilities.
