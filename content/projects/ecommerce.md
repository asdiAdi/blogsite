After making the [connect4](/projects/connect4-app) app. I was confident and wanted to make an ecommerce app.
Why? Because ecommerce is one of the most widely used applications on the internet.
As such there are a lot of technologies made for it.
The number of ecommerce websites in the internet is insane.
Learning it inside out might give me some job security.

I decided to use the most popular frameworks for it so thinking it would be an easier approach.
I used Next.js for SSR, Nestjs for backend, Postgresql for database and AWS for deployment.
The design is not mine though, I copied it from a paid template on Material UI hahaha.
I just went to their demo website and replicate it using DaisyUI and Tailwind.
