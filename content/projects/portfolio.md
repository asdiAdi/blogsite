I made a portfolio website.
<!--more-->

{{< details summary="TLDR" >}}
- Made for job application. Scrapped because it's too childish.
- Technologies used: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Animata](https://animata.design/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
{{< /details >}}

I quit my onsite job and I thought I needed a portfolio website to showcase my projects.
I redeployed my old projects on AWS.
I designed my portfolio based on other peoples website and kept what I liked about them.
Overall I was satisfied with the end result.
There is a profile, about, project and contact pages.

In the end, I decided to not use it on my resume.
I just thought that it was really childish.
Nothing screams junior more than a portfolio website.
I don't really need it.
This will only hurt my chances because the projects I included are ancient.

Anyway, I still deployed it because it looked nice hehe.
