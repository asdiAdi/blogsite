I tried making a Rest API using AWS Gateway inside AWS Amplify
<!--more-->

{{< details summary="TLDR" >}}
- Technologies used: [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/)
{{< /details >}}

I decided to make a basic rest api complete with a frontend design to jog my memory.
Frontend is minimal, it will fetch the random quote of the day.

Backend is where I added some functions.
- CRUD endpoints
- Auth using API-KEYS distributed by SUPABASE USERS
- Rest API using GATEWAY with Lambda proxy integration

-- Currently in progress.
