Why did I make did website?
<!--more-->

I wanted to start a blogging website where I can share my programming journey and random things.
The problem was I have decision paralysis again and again.
I don’t know If I should start or not.

A lot of questions bother me like:
- How can I share my website if I’m scared of attention?
- Should I monetize my blog?
- Why do I want to monetize my blog?
- Didn’t I want to make my blog as a sort of journal entries so I can learn programming better?
- Would people even read this?
- Why would I care if people would read this? 

And a lot of negative thoughts like:
- I don’t even have the technical writing experience.
- My English sucks.
- The time requirement to produce a blog as too high.
- No one will read this.
- This is a waste of time.

With that in mind, instead of doing something productive, I’m spending hours overthinking about stuff that shouldn’t matter.
Conflict clouds my brain and I can’t think clearly. So I did what most people with decision paralysis do.
Research the internet for hours on end about what to do and ended up with more questions than before.
This cycle will continue to repeat if I don’t do something.

So I decided to just write this piece. Write my thoughts without thinking.
Write without restructuring everything to perfection.
Just type words straight from your brain.
And as I am typing this, I have decided that I will make the damn blog.
It doesn’t matter if no one reads this.
It doesn’t matter if I don’t earn money.
It doesn’t matter if what I write is bad.
And it really doesn’t matter if what I’m doing is a waste of time.
What matters is that I do what I want.
Why do I care if what I’m doing matters to no one else but me?

So anyway, this blog will all be about my journey on programming, hobbies and art.
This will be about teaching myself technologies that I have learned.
I want to look back and relearn everything if I ever forgot to do it again.
Mostly more technical stuff maybe, who knows? maybe I’ll change my mind later on.
It will also be about my journey with art?
I’m still not sure though.
I guess I just want to have my own little corner in the internet.
